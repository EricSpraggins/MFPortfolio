        <p class="fs-5 welcome">Hello my dear friend who has stumbled upon my humble abode. This is the first iteration of my coding portfolio, determined to be both unique and exhibitive of what I have learned in my journey through the world of coding. As you scroll through this page, you'll find a few examples of what I have learned to create thus far. Should you wish to learn more about myself, the coder, please feel free to visit the about page. In the projects folder, you will find a personal project I'm working on to further develop myself, whilst staying true to my likes and interests. Finally, in the contact page, you will find links to where you can find me on various social medias. Thank you for taking an interest in perusing my page!</p>

        <p>Thank you so much for taking a look through my portfolio. I have put many hours and innumerable attempts to reconcile and balance all of the new techniques I have learned in this course to create this website. While I may be a beginner, I am quite proud of the work I have presented to you here today, and even more motivated than before to take everything I've learned to the next level. Stayed tuned for more development as I learn even more about this amazing world. Until, this is your captain, sailing off for another Grand Line of Code!</p>
