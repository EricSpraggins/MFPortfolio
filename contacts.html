    <div class="ab">Thank you for taking an interest in not just my work but myself as a person. I will admit that I do not, as of yet, have many forms of social media with which you can find and reach me. That being said, the following three links should be able to connect you to my pages on each of those social medias. Since you've made it this far, I look forward to hearing from you. Have a great day!</div>
