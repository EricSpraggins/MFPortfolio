    <h1>Eric's Enigmatic Explanation</h1>
    <section>Congratulations! You have somehow stumbled upon my humble abode. My name is Eric Spraggins. I am a beginning coder attempting to learn another new thing about this world through the wonderous marvels that are found within the process of computer coding. I have a dual Bachelor's in Criminology and Pscyhology, but shortly after my graduation, had to step away from school to assist my mother through her recovery. Since then I have been attempting to get back onto the road of self-discovery and self-help, and this is one pathway in which I seek to accomplish this. Although I am still learning, and will continue to learn daily, the art of the code, I work diligently as a tutor, seeking to assist in the development of knowledge for those that seek it. Being able to assist people to find understanding in things that have until then eluded them is one of the best sensations, and once I have learned the art of the code, I hope to be able to assist others in an entirely different way. So long as I continue to put one foot down in front of the other, I doubt that there is anything I will fail to accomplish. I may stumble and I may fall, but I will rise again, each and every time, to continue the fight.</section>
